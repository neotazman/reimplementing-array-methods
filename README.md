# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Reimplement Array Methods

Follow the instructions provided on my.kenzie.academy for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it and/or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection**, but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).
